**Commentary**

The limited liability company (hereinafter LLC) is neither a corporation nor a partnership; rather, it is a distinct type of entity.  An LLC is governed by title 3, chapter 101 of the Texas Business Organizations Code  (BOC).    Title  1,  chapter  3,  subchapter  A  of  the  BOC  governs  the  formation  of  an  LLC  and  sets forth the provisions required or permitted to be contained in the certificate of formation.  The owners of an LLC are cal le d  _“members.”_  A n L L C  may have one or more members.  M embers may be individuals, partnerships, corporations, and any other type of legal entity.  [BR]

**Instructions for Form**

* **Article  1—Entity  Name  and  Type:**  Provide  a  company  name  and  organizational  designation.  Under section 5.053 of the BOC, if the name chosen is the same as, deceptively similar to, or similar to the name of any existing domestic or foreign filing entity, or any name reservation or registration filed with the secretary of state, the document cannot be filed.  The administrative rules adopted for determining  entity  name  availability  (Texas  Administrative Code,  title  1,  part  4,  chapter  79, subchapter  C)  may  be  viewed  at _www.sos.state.tx.us/tac/index.shtml._    If  you  wish  the  secretary  of state to provide a preliminary determination on name availability, you may call (512) 463-5555, dial 7-1-1  for  relay  services,  or  e-mail   your  name   inquiry  to corpinfo@sos.state.tx.us.    A   final determination cannot be made until the document is received and processed by the secretary of state.  Do  not  make  financial  expenditures  or  execute  documents  based on  a  preliminary  clearance.    Also note that the preclearance of a name or the issuance of a certificate of formation under a name does not authorize the use of a name in violation of another person’s rights to the name.
* **Article 2—Registered Agent and Registered Office:**  The registered agent can be either (option A) a  domestic  entity  or  a  foreign  entity  that  is  registered  to  do  business  in  Texas  or  (option  B)  an individual resident of the state.  The limited liability company cannot act as its own registered agent; do not enter the limited liability company name as the name of the registered agent.

_Consent_:    Effective  January  1,  2010,  a  person  designated  as  the  registered  agent  of  an  entity  must have  consented, either  in  a written or electronic  form, to serve as the registered agent of the entity.  Although consent is required, a copy of the person’s written or electronic consent need not be submitted with the certificate of  formation.  _The liabilities and penalties imposed by sections 4.007 and  4.008  of  the  BOC  apply  with  respect  to  a  false  statement  in  a  filing  instrument  that  names  a person as the registered agent of an entity without that person’s consent._ (BOC § 5.207)

If  the LLC  will  not  have  managers,  select option B and provide the name and address of each initial member of the LLC in the space provided.  _A minimum of one person is required._ If the governing person is an individual, set forth the name of the individual in the format specified.

If the governing person is an organization, set  forth  the  legal  name  of  the  organization.    For each  governing  person,  only  one  name  should  be entered.  Do not include both the name of an individual and the name of an organization.An address is always required for each governing person. ``Please note that a document on file with the secretary of state is a public record that is subject to public access and disclosure.

This form provides for the creation of an LLC with a general purpose.

The additional space provided in the “Supplemental Provisions/Information” section may be used to set forth a more specific purpose or purposes.

However,  before  signing,  please  read  the  statements  on  this  form  carefully.    <u>The  designation  or appointment of a person as registered agent by an organizer is an affirmation that the person named in  the  certificate  of  formation  has  consented  to  serve  in  that  capacity.</u>(BOC  §  5.2011,  effective January 1, 2010) 

_A person commits an offense under section 4.008 of the BOC if the person signs or directs the filing of  a  filing  instrument  the  person  knows  is  materially  false  with  the  intent  that  the  instrument  be delivered  to  the  secretary  of  state  for  filing.    The  offense  is  a  Class  A  misdemeanor  unless  the person’s intent is to harm or defraud another, in which case the offense is a state jail felony._

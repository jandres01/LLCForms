Re:		TF REI LCC

Dear Mr Flores,

It is our pleasure to have helped you form TF REI LLC.

In the enclosed packet you will find all the legal documents needed to commence your venture:

1)	State Certificate of Formation [BR]

a.	The Certificate of Formation was filed with and accepted by the Secretary of State which issued an acknowledgment of filing for the LLC.   The Certificate of Formation establishes the LLC and sets out its fundamental structure (Prior to the Texas Business Organizations Code which became effective on January 1, 2006, the Certificate of Formation was referred to as the "Articles of Organization"). 

2)	State Filing Certificate

a.	This is to document the State issues in order to acknowledge TF REI LLC filed a Certificate of Formation.

3)	EIN Taxpayer ID Filing

a.	If the LLC will be paying wages to employees, this EIN number will need to be attached to any accounts from which funds are paid to employees.  Compliance is governed by the IRS.

4)	LLC Operating Agreement

a.	The rules and procedures for running the LLC are set forth in the Company Operating Agreement.  You should review the Company Agreement along with the Certificate of Formation in order to familiarize yourself with how the LLC should be operated.  The Company Agreement should be reviewed any time the LLC intends to take action.  Once approved, the Company Agreement may be amended as provided therein, if necessary.

5)	Acceptance of Appointment as Manager

a.	As the designated Manager of the Company, you must accept formally your designation as Manager.

6)	Organizational Meeting Minutes

a.	The Minutes of the Organizational Meeting of the Manager(s) of TF REI LLC sets forth the steps taken by the initial Manager to complete the organization of the LLC.  These steps include, among other items, adopting the Company Agreement.

You have elected to be your own Registered Agent. The Texas Secretary of State says, “an entity’s registered agent is an agent of the entity on whom may be served any process, notice, or demand required or permitted by law to be served on the entity.” In the event you move, make sure to update your Registered Agent contact information with the Secretary of State.

Additionally you will find a document for your records that you may need if you change Registered Agent and/or Registered Agent address in the State of Texas, and elect not to use us:

7)	Form 401 - Change of Registered Agent and/or Registered Office

This packet includes all that is required for your valid LLC formation in Texas, but we also want to make you aware of the legalities surrounding this material.

[CENTER] 
**Tax Matters and Licenses**

We have prepared the enclosed documents based upon information and instructions you provided.  We have not represented or held ourselves out to be a tax expert.  You should be aware that formation of this LLC may affect your future tax obligations.  You should carefully review all of the tax aspects of this entity with your accountant, paying special attention to the issue of whether to elect Subchapter S status.

**Sub Chapter S Election**. A Corporation that is a qualified small business corporation under the Internal Revenue Code may elect to be taxed as a Subchapter S corporation (pass-through taxation).  A Subchapter S corporation does not pay income tax.  Instead, the Members are taxed directly on entity income.  Election of Subchapter S status is made by filing Form 2553 with the Internal Revenue Service.  Form 2553 must be filed within seventy five (75) days of the commencement of business.  As many small business corporations elect Subchapter S status, you should consult with your accountant regarding whether or not it is desirable for the Corporation to make such an election.  If you have organized as an LLC or PLLC, you are automatically taxed under pass-through taxation in a manner similar to a Subchapter S Corporation, and do not need to file an election unless you intend for the LLC to be taxed as a stand-alone entity.

**Liability for Nonpayment of FICA Taxes and Federal Withholding Taxes**.  If the LLC fails to pay FICA taxes and withholding taxes, the persons responsible for payment of such taxes will be held personally liable.  Officers or other personnel whose duties relate to the payment of such taxes may be found liable.

**Franchise Tax**.  With limited exceptions, Texas limited liability companies are subject to the Texas franchise tax.  You should discuss the franchise tax and possible methods for minimizing this tax with your accountant.

**Texas Sales and Use Tax Permit**.  The LLC should obtain a Limited Sales Permit from the Comptroller of Public Accounts for the State of Texas for each place of business it will operate in the state, if the LLC will engage in retail or rental business or perform taxable services.  You should discuss this matter with your accountant in order to ensure that the proper steps are taken to secure the permits.

**Business or Occupational Licenses and Taxes**.  Various business activities and occupations are subject to licensing requirements, occupational taxes or fees.  If you are unsure if the LLC must obtain certain licenses, you should discuss this with me, your accountant, or the appropriate licensing authority.

**Formation**[BR]

**Capitalization of the LLC**.  If a Member is paying for a membership interest in cash, the cash should be deposited in the LLC's bank account.  If the Member is paying for a membership interest by transferring property to the LLC, the property should be actually delivered to the LLC and the appropriate documentation completed.  If a Member is paying for a membership interest by performing services, a memo should be prepared and filed in the minute book reflecting the services provided or to be provided.

**Bank Account**.  A new bank account should be opened in the name of the LLC, or an exiting account should be linked with the new EIN.  This transaction should be accomplished easily by completing a resolution which authorizes the company to open a bank account.  Some banks also have their own form for the resolution that the LLC can use.

**Assets and Insurance**.  All assets transferred by you or any other Member to the LLC should be appropriately entered upon the company's books by your accountant.  Any assets so transferred become the property of the LLC.  All of your business insurance (public liability, disability, general insurance, etc.) must be acquired in the name of the LLC as well.

**Existing Loans**.  Any existing loans which you have made in the business should be transferred to and assumed by the LLC when and if your accountant determines that no adverse tax consequences will result from such assumption of liability.

**Other Existing Agreements or Arrangements**.  All leases, contracts and other arrangements which you have regarding your present equipment, office premises or furniture and any other contracts or arrangements which you have previously entered into in connection with your business should be modified, assigned, or rewritten in order to reflect the fact that the LLC is the contracting party to each lease, contract, or obligation.

If you require any assistance, we would be happy to help you document any of the above.

[center]
**Accounting**[BR]

**Keep the Accountant Informed**.  The Manager of the LLC is responsible for ensuring that the LLC's accounting practices are maintained in a proper and timely fashion.  The LLC's accountant should be kept informed regarding the LLC's business activities.

**Accounting Matters**.  Initially, the accountant should resolve questions regarding tax elections and other tax matters discussed above, transfers of accounts receivable, and the payment of your accounts payable.  Your accountant should advise you if your first fiscal year should end on a date other than the calendar year end, of what tax elections should be made by you at that time and all matters related to the preparation and filing of tax returns.

**Distributions**.  Distributions of cash or other assets of the LLC are made in the manner provided for in the regulations.  Before declaring distributions, however, it would be wise to consult with your accountant and this firm since there are complex tax factors that must be taken into consideration upon the declaration of any distributions.

**Compensation**.  The Members are not ordinarily entitled to compensation for their services as members unless the compensation is provided for by contract, by the Company Agreement, or by a company resolution.  The Manager has the additional power to fix the salary of each and all of the officers.  Elaborate compensation plans for Manager(s), or employees should be submitted for approval as with any other important transaction.

[center]
**Formalities**[BR]

**Conducting Business in the Name of the LLC**.  It is very important that all necessary formalities be followed in order to maintain the existence and activities of the LLC distinct and separate from the Members, Manager and other as yet determined officers, in order to ensure that the such persons do not become personally liable for the liabilities or claims against the LLC.  This would be true even if there were only one member.  Personal property of the Members must not be commingled with the property of the LLC.  You should at all times do business under the LLC name exactly as specified in the Certificate of Formation and not deviate therefrom unless an appropriate assumed name certificate has been filed.

**Bank Accounts and Loans**.  Your bank and checking accounts should also reflect your LLC's name.  Any loans or banking activities should be conducted in the LLC's name rather than your name individually, even though you may be required to endorse or guarantee the same personally.  If a loan is made and the lender requires you to endorse or guarantee the loan personally, you should have the above action approved by the Manager and reflect the approval in an appropriately drafted resolution which is inserted into the company's minute book or records.

**Signatures**.  Whenever a person signs on behalf of or for the LLC, they should add their title next to the signature so that it will be clear that they are acting as an agent of the LLC rather than in their individual capacity.  For instance, if you sign a contract with just your name and do not state your relationship to the LLC next to your name in the contract, you may be held personally liable for the contract.  An example of a correct signature would be:

LLC Name

By: [CENTER]
${organizer.signature.show(width='2in')} [BR]
${organizer.title} ${organizer.name}

**Transactions**.  All important transactions affecting the LLC should be documented by the Manager in Minutes or other appropriate documentation, including:

•	All major contracts, including employment contracts, buy-sell agreements, profit sharing plans, pension plans, insurance plans, trust agreements, loans, leases, purchase contracts, and limited liability brokerage and investment accounts should be made in the name and on behalf of the LLC and with the required approval.
•	The establishment and adjustment of all salaries and bonuses of officers and employees, if any, of the LLC.
•	Issuance of additional membership interests by the Members. Any change in membership interests should not only be reported to your accountant and this firm, but must also be reflected in the membership register in the LLC minute book or other records such as a list documenting the percentage or other membership interest owned by each Member.
•	Restrictions on the transfer of membership interests.
•	Issuance of additional membership interests and purchase or sale of other membership interests in the LLC.
•	Acceptance of resignation, termination, or appointment of managers.
•	Change of LLC name, registered office, or registered agent.
•	Change of bank accounts.
•	Any other LLC activities which are significant.

**Special Meetings**.  Actions of the Manager may be taken either at an actual meeting, in which case it is advisable to maintain written minutes of such meeting, or in the form of an unanimous written consent action embodying the desired resolutions.  Unanimous written consent actions must be executed by all of the persons entitled to vote on the matters contained therein.  When the LLC has only a Manager it is generally simpler and more convenient to take action by unanimous written consent rather than through actual meetings.

**Annual Meetings**.  The annual meetings must be held as provided in the Company Agreement.  The time and place of the annual meetings may be changed by resolution. Any significant activities or transactions that have not previously been the subject of any special meetings should be reflected and ratified at the Annual Meetings.  Please contact this firm if you desire our assistance in helping you prepare the requisite resolutions and minutes or records to document any special or annual meetings.

**Books and Minutes**.  The LLC should maintain a minute book that is kept up-to-date.  The LLC minute book is available for inspection by any Member.  The books of the LLC should include the following items:

•	The LLC's Certificate of Formation, Company Agreement, Organizational Meeting Minutes, any other certificates filed with the Secretary of State, and any amendments or restatements of such certificates.
•	All resolutions, minutes of meetings, notices, written consents, etc., that are prepared in the future.
•	A current list of Members, including (a) the date on which such person became a Member, (b) the name and mailing address, (c) the percentage or other interest in the LLC, (d) the consideration paid for the interest and (e) the Member's total commitment representing his or her membership interest in the LLC.
•	Copies of federal, state, and local information or income tax returns.

**Other LLC Matters**[BR]

**Significant Change**.  Please contact this firm immediately if any important change occurs that would affect the membership of the LLC. In such an event, it may be critical that the proper process is followed to avoid any negative consequences to the LLC or the Members.

**Assumed Name**.  If the LLC will transact business or operate under a name that is different in any way from the exact name as set forth in the Certificate of Formation filed with the Secretary of State, the LLC will need to file an assumed name certificate.  This certificate must be filed with the Secretary of State and the County Clerk of the county in which the LLC has its registered office.  If the principal office of the LLC is in a county other than the county where the registered office is located, the certificate must be filed in that county as well.  Also, the certificate will need to be renewed within six months prior to its expiration.

**Operations in Another State**.  Finally, should you open an office or acquire property in another state, you may be required to qualify as a foreign entity to be authorized to do business in that state.  This entails filing a Certificate of Authority in that other state and paying initial and annual fees.  Failure to qualify may prohibit you from suing to enforce your contracts in that state, or from receiving actual notice in the event you are sued.


We hope the information in this letter will prove helpful.  This letter is intended to inform you of some of the more common issues affecting LLCs and future management and operations.  **This letter is not an exhaustive overview of all legal, economic or other considerations pertaining to LLCs**.

As a continuing matter of sound practice, we strongly recommend that you meet with our firm at least once annually, preferably a couple of weeks before your annual meetings.  This will help ensure that the required steps have been taken and all business affairs are in order.

If you have additional questions concerning the LLC or future operations, please call us at your earliest convenience. We stand ready to assist you.
